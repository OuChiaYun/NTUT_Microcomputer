  "readme": "### req\n\nreq is a very simple command line wrapper around Mikeal Roger's excellent [request](https://github.com/mikeal/request) library.\n\nreq tries to make some guesses as to what you'd really like to do. When a body is detected as parseable json, req will send it with the appropriate content-type.\nWhen sending a file, req will base the Content-Type on the file's extension. On a GET request, req will print text and json to stdout, while other requests will\nbe saved to a file according to either a Content-Disposition filename or the path of the request. You can override this, of course, by using the -o flag (works for text and json as well).\nAny headers that you manually specify will always take precedence over req's guesses.\n\nI wrote this little wrapper because I got tired of curl's massive man-page and unintuitive flags. Is it as powerful as curl? Probably not, but it is definitely easier to use.\n\nUsage:\n\n    Usage: req [options] [method] uri\n\n    Methods:\n      Any valid HTTP method is supported. If unspecified, GET will be used.\n\n    Options:\n      -h, --headers      Headers to attach to the request in the form header=value                                                                                                                  \n      -q, --querystring  Querystring parameters in the form param=value (these can also be passed as part of the URI)                                                                               \n      -b, --body         The body of the request. If this is set to valid json, it will automatically set the json content-type. Can also attach the contents of the file using e.g. @uploadthis.txt\n      -o, --output       File to write output to, otherwise will print text and json to screen and guess a filename for binaries                                                                    \n      -u, --username     Username for basic auth                                                                                                                                                    \n      -p, --password     Password for basic auth                                                                                                                                                    \n      -f, --form         Similar to the body flag, but sends the data as x-www-form-urlencoded                                                                                                       \n      -v, --verbose      Output response headers and status codes   \n\n\nSome examples:\n\nTo upload the file picture.jpg to example.com (assumes a POST request, automatically sets Content-Type to image/jpeg based on file extension)\n\n    req -b @picture.jpg example.com/pictures\n\nTo PUT some plain text as form data (x-www-form-urlencoded)\n\n    req put -f 'formdata' example.com/forms\n\nTo POST a JSON blob to example.com/users?user=tom (automatically detects valid json and sets Content-Type to application/json)\n\n    req -b '{\"status\": \"bored\"}' -q user=tom example.com/users\n\nSetting multiple query strings or headers is as easy as adding more -q or -h flags (PUT example.com/users?user=tom&status=bored&location=home)\n\n    req put -q user=tom -q status=bored -q location=home example.com/users\n\nBasic auth? Not a problem! (Note that currently you must specify these inline. A prompt will be coming in the next version)\n\n    req -u username -p password secureexample.com\n\nDownload a file\n\n    req example.com/download.exe\n\nSpecify a location\n\n    req example.com/download.exe -o realname.exe\n",
